# OM (OnDA Monitor): Online Data Analysis for X-Ray Imaging

## What is OM?

**OM** (**O**nDA **M**onitor) is a framework for the development of programs that can
**monitor** x-ray imaging **experiments** in **real-time**. It is also a set of
ready-to-use monitoring programs.

It is the spiritual successor of the **OnDA Project** and it is maintained mostly by
the same team of developers.

OM offers a set of stable and efficient **real-time monitoring programs** for the most
common types of x-ray imaging experiments. These **can be used immediately** without
modifications or **can be easily adapted** to meet the usersâ€™ requirements. In
addition, the project provides a set of modules that can be used to **easily develop**
other monitoring programs, tailored to the characteristics of specific experiments.

OM can process imaging data in the **broadest sense**: multidimensional pixel-based
data (for example: diffraction patterns, photoemission spectrums, images from cameras,
microscopes or x-ray detectors), but also any kind of digital output from an
instrument or sensor (temperature readouts, beam and pulse energies, etc.).

OM focuses on **scalability and portability**, in order to facilitate its adoption
for a wide array of facilities and instruments. It also strives for **stability and
performance**. To achieve these goals, OM processes data in a multi-node parallel
environment, using free and open-source libraries and protocols.

OM is written in **Python**. The use of the Python programming language, which is
particularly suited to rapid development, makes OM **easy to modify** and to adapt to
the requirements of specific experiments.

OM also aims to keep its code base **simple and as small**. The focus is on providing
useful core functionality, while allowing the framework to be expanded with external
software. The goal is to avoid re-implementing algorithms that are already better
optimized in other software packages.

## The OM Development Team

### Active Developers

OM is currently developed at the Linac Coherent Light Source facility
[(LCLS)](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu) of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

However, several collaborators from different institutions all over the world
contribute code, testing and support to the project.

The current core development team includes the following people:

* **Valerio Mariani** (corresponding developer:
  [valmar@slac.stanford.edu](mailto:valmar@slac.stanford.edu))
* Alexandra Tolstikova
* Thomas Grant


### Contributors

Several people have, over the years, contributed to the development and testing of OM
with code, bug reports, ideas, etc. Some still do, occasionally. The following list
might not be exhaustive:
