    Detected peaks information.

    This typed dictionary stores information about a set of peaks found by a
    peak-finding algorithm in a detector data frame.

    Attributes:

        num_peaks: The number of peaks detected in the data frame.

        fs: A list of fractional fs indexes that locate the detected peaks in the data
            frame.

        ss: A list of fractional ss indexes that locate the detected peaks in the data
            frame.

        intensity: A list of integrated intensities for the detected peaks.

        num_pixels: A list storing the number of pixels in each detected peak.

        max_pixel_intensity: A list storing, for each peak, the value of the pixel with
            the maximum intensity.

        snr: A list storing  the signal-to-noise ratio of each detected peak.
