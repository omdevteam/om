# Running OM

Although OM is installed and available at several synchrotron and free electron laser
facilities, special machines and network arrangements are often needed to run it
efficiently at the various beamlines where it is available.

Tools and graphical interfaces that will allow users to comfortably start, stop and run
OM at several facilities are currently under development.

For now, if someone is interested in using OM for an experiment, the best strategy is
to contact one of the core developers. The core development team will be happy to help
setting up and running OM.
